Starting notes: 
Today I work on a rock paper scissors project to practice my skills with JavaScript. I've learned about the fundamental theories, and now I'll try to do a project on it. 

Finishing notes:
I created seperate files for the end product. index.html and main.js are the files for the game. During this project I learned how to work with functions, as well as DOM manipulation. I'm happy with the result, as it was not easy, but now I have a nice playable game. Rock paper scissors against the computer.
